NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises, covenants, and undertakings set
forth herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the sufficiency of which is hereby
acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:
1. Non-Compete Obligation
The Employee agrees that for a period of {{non_compete_period}} following the termination of
their employment with the Company, whether such termination is voluntary or involuntary, and
whether the Employee is terminated with or without cause, they shall not, within the
geographical area of {{geographical_area}}, engage in or participate in any business, whether
as an owner, shareholder, partner, employee, consultant, contractor, or in any other capacity,
that directly competes with the business of the Company. The Employee further agrees not to
establish, own, operate, or be employed by any business that provides goods or services that
are substantially similar to those provided by the Company during the course of their
employment, or that could reasonably be considered to be in direct competition with the
Company's products, services, or target market.
2. Scope of Competition
The Employee acknowledges that the business of the Company is highly competitive, and that
the Company has invested substantial time, resources, and effort in developing its business
operations, strategies, client base, and intellectual property. Consequently, the Employee
agrees not to directly or indirectly use any confidential information, knowledge, skills, or
relationships gained during the course of their employment to compete with the Company in any
capacity, whether for personal gain or otherwise. The Employee agrees that this restriction
applies to the specific field or industry in which the Company operates, and shall not extend
beyond reasonable geographical and temporal limits, as defined in this Agreement.
3. Consideration for the Agreement
In consideration for the Employee agreeing to the terms of this Non-Compete Agreement, the
Company has provided the Employee with {{consideration_amount}}, which is a valid and lawful
consideration for entering into this restrictive covenant. The Employee acknowledges receipt of
this consideration and understands the legal and professional responsibilities associated with
the execution of this Agreement.
4. Competing Business Description
For the purposes of this Agreement, a "competing business" shall refer to any entity, individual,
or organization involved in the same or substantially similar business activities as the Company,
including but not limited to businesses providing {{competing_business_description}}. The
Employee acknowledges that the Company has a significant competitive advantage, and the
restrictions imposed by this Agreement are essential to protecting the Company's market
position and intellectual property.
5. Exceptions to the Non-Compete Obligation
The Employee shall not be prohibited from engaging in business activities or employment that
are not in direct competition with the Company. For purposes of clarity, the Employee is
permitted to engage in any business or employment activities that do not involve the use of the
Company's confidential information, intellectual property, or client relationships, and which do
not violate the restrictive covenants outlined in this Agreement.
6. Enforcement and Remedies for Breach
The Employee acknowledges that any violation of this Agreement would cause the Company
irreparable harm, and that monetary damages may be inadequate to remedy such a breach.
Therefore, in the event of any violation or threatened violation of the non-compete provisions,
the Company shall be entitled to seek immediate injunctive relief or other equitable remedies to
prevent or restrain such a breach, in addition to any other remedies available under law. The
Employee further agrees to indemnify the Company for any damages, costs, or liabilities arising
from any violation of this Agreement, including but not limited to reasonable legal fees and
expenses.
7. Duration and Geographical Scope of Non-Compete Obligation
The duration of the non-compete obligation, as set forth in this Agreement, shall be for a period
of {{non_compete_period}}, following the termination of the Employee's employment. The
geographical scope of this obligation shall be limited to the area within {{geographical_area}},
where the Company has business interests or where the Employee has worked during the last
two years of their employment.
8. Termination Conditions
The Employee acknowledges and agrees that the non-compete obligations set forth in this
Agreement shall remain in effect regardless of the circumstances surrounding the termination of
their employment. The non-compete obligation will only be voided if termination occurs under
conditions such as {{termination_condition}}, provided that such conditions are explicitly stated
by the Company in writing at the time of the termination.
9. Confidentiality and Duration After Termination
In addition to the non-compete obligations, the Employee agrees to maintain the confidentiality
of all proprietary and sensitive information belonging to the Company, for a period of
{{confidentiality_duration}} after the termination of their employment, unless required by law or
as expressly authorized by the Company. The confidentiality obligations shall survive the
termination of this Agreement.
10. Penalty Clause for Breach
The Employee agrees that if they violate the terms of this Agreement, including but not limited to
engaging in a competing business, the Company shall be entitled to impose a penalty of
{{penalty_clause}}. This penalty shall be in addition to any legal remedies available under
applicable law.
11. Dispute Resolution
Any dispute arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, including its validity,
interpretation, or enforcement, shall be resolved through {{dispute_resolution_method}}. The
parties agree to submit any such disputes to mediation or arbitration, as appropriate, before
pursuing any legal action in court.
12. Governing Law and Jurisdiction
This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of India. Any
dispute arising out of or in connection with this Agreement shall be subject to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the courts located in {{city_of_jurisdiction}}, {{state_of_jurisdiction}}, and the
Employee expressly submits to the jurisdiction of such courts.
13. Entire Agreement and Amendments
This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding between the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements, whether oral or written, regarding
the non-compete obligations. Any amendments, modifications, or waivers of this Agreement
shall be made in writing and executed by both parties.
